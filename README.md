## Days without incident

### Features

- Keeps a record of the current streak and the previous best.
- Offers a shortcut button to report an incident.
- Offers a shortcut button to review the stats.
- Adjusts for the length of day on the current surface.  All-night games will use the default day length.  If you have advice how to make that work across many planets with different day/night cycles, please let me know.
